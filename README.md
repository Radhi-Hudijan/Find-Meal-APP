# Find Meal APP (vanilla JS)

This repo is an example of Single Page Application that uses a hash-based router, all written in vanilla JavaScript (no libraries used). It can also serve as a starter project for building your own application based on the same principles.

For the "why" of this starter repo, see: [Motivation](./MOTIVATION.md).
